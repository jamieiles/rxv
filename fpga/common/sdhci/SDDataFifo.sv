// Multi-block data buffer between the data engine and the buffer data port.
//
// The buffer is a FIFO of 32-bit words in block RAM, the direction is fixed
// for each transfer: the data engine fills it and the CPU drains it for reads
// and vice versa for writes.  Several blocks are buffered so that the card
// can keep transferring while the CPU empties or fills the buffer, and so
// that the CPU can move more than one block per interrupt.  Block level
// status is derived here:
//
//   buf_rd_en: Buffer Read Enable, at least one received block has been
//              checked and is ready to be read.
//   buf_wr_en: Buffer Write Enable, there is space for a block and the CPU
//              still has blocks to write.
//   blk_space: there is space for the data engine to receive a block.
//   blk_avail: a whole block has been written by the CPU and can be sent.
//
// The RAM has a registered read port addressed by the next read pointer so
// that the head of the FIFO is always available without a read latency, a
// write to the location being read is bypassed.
